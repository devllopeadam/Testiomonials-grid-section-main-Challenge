            the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12

            ‶Before joining the bootcamp, I've
            never written a line of code. I needed
            some structure from professionals
            who can help me learn programming
            step by step. I was encouraged to
            enroll by a former student ot theirs
            who can only say wonderful things
            about the program. The entire
            curriculum and staff did not
            disappoint, They were very hands-on
            and I never had to wait long for
            assistance. The agile team project. in
            particular, was outstanding. It took
            my learning to the next level in a way
            that no tutorial could ever have. In
            fact. rve often referred to it during
            interviews as an example of my
            developent experience, It certainly
            helped me land a job as a full-stack
            developer after receiving multiple
            offers. 100% recommend!"
